               Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Michael McNulty.
           </p>
           <p>
               I am a recent Cyber Security graduate and am passionate about all things related to digital security and privacy. As our world becomes more and more reliant on technology, it is increasingly important to protect our digital assets and personal information from threats such as hacking, phishing, and malware attacks.
           </p>
           <p>
               Through my studies, I have gained a deep understanding of the technical and theoretical aspects of cyber security, including network security, cryptography, and information assurance. I have also developed practical skills in risk assessment, threat analysis, and incident response.
           </p>
           <p>
               I am excited to continue my journey in cyber security, and I look forward to exploring new technologies, strategies, and solutions to protect our digital lives. Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about me.
           </p>
